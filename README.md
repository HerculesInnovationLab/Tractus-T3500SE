# Using the Tractus-T3500SE

## Overview
The Tractus printer we have here at the HIL was purchased from the company Tractus in early 2023.
This is a very large format printer, it prints aproxomatly 1 meter diameter by 2 meter tall.
It is a Delta style printer, and comes with 2 interchangable heads and an attachable bed probe.

The system is a Reprap Logicboard tightly integrated with a raspberry pi (displayed on the large screen).
The Raspberry Pi is on the HIL Staff wifi, and is assisable at 192.168.1.44
The password will not be posted here, but is with HIL staff.

### ${\textsf{\color{red}WARNING!}}$ Operating the Tractus printer with the door open is not advised.
The head can move quite quickly at times, and is some what unpradictable.
It is advised to keep the door shut as much as possible.
During 1st layer calibration care will have to be taken to not be in the path of the print head.

### ${\textsf{\color{yellow}CAUTION!}}$ The print bed is ...**glass**... DO NOT PLACE UNDUE WEIGHT ON IT.
Doing so could missalign the bed, requireing a new mesh compensation.
EXTEME care should be taken when moveing Z to 0. 
Any impact with the print head COULD damage the glass bed.
